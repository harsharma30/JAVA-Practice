======================String in JAVA=======================>
What is String?

if you find string and String in your java code, how you will explain without known alot..

=====================Access Scope==========================>
1. WithinClass
	-> private
	-> protected
	-> default
	-> public

2. ChildClass
	-> no private 
	-> protected
	-> default
	-> public

3. NonChildClass but same package
	-> no private 
	-> no protected
	-> default
	-> public

4. ChildClass but diff package
	-> no private 
	-> protected
	-> no default
	-> public

5. NonChildClass but diff package
	-> no private 
	-> no protected
	-> no default
	-> public


======================Polymorphism in JAVA===================>
When we are creating more then one method have same name but different parameters may be with in the same class or child class is known as polymorphism.
1. Compile time polymorphism
	Same class having more than one method having same name but diff parameters.

2. Run time polymorphism
	We can achieve by maintaining parent child relation
	
3. Pure runtime polymorphism
